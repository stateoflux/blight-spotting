Blight Spotting
===============

A Geo-spatial visualization of blight related issues reported via the SeeClickFix app.

I live in a neighborhood where illegal dumping and other blight related issues are a huge problem and I was curious to see what was the geographical distribution of illegal dumping issues in other parts of Oakland. I decided to build this tool that pulls 100 of the most recent blight related issues filed by people using the [SeeClickFix](http://seeclickfix.com/) app and place markers on a Google map to represent their location.
